#Toy Problems


##Description 


A toy problem is intended to illustrate various problem solving methods. It can be easily used by different researchers to compare the performance of algorithms.

## Instructions
Step 1: Understand the “30,000 ft” View
This might seem like a no-brainer, but you’d be surprised at how often I ask my students to re-state a problem they’re facing and they surprise themselves by how little they understand the problem.

Take some time to truly understand exactly what the question prompt is asking. What is the problem you’re really trying to solve?

Step 2: Document Your Algorithm
The next step to converting your problem statement into an algorithm. This is a lot easier than it sounds, especially since we’ll be writing this algorithm in plain english.

Even better, we can use code comments to put these algorithms directly into our code.

Step 3: Implement The Algorithm In-Place
The final step is to implement each step of the algorithm inside the comments. This has two benefits: First, it documents exactly what each part of your code is doing; Second, it allows you to easily and quickly switch between your low-level “10 ft view” to the high-level “30,000 ft view”. You can use the comments as a guide to ensure that the code you’re writing is described by the comment above it.
